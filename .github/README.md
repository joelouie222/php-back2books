## üìù Project Overview

**Back2Books** is a database-driven web application developed as a class project for the CS 3773 Software Engineering course at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Written primarily in PHP, at its core, the project is a three-tier web application that currently functions as a centralized online bookstore. The website acts as the sole seller, managing a catalog of used textbooks that users can browse and purchase.

The project was built by a five-person student team ("Team 9: Operation B2B") and serves as a practical demonstration of applying software engineering principles‚Äîfrom initial design and project management to development and deployment. The long-term vision for the project is to evolve it from its current single-seller model into a dynamic, peer-to-peer marketplace where users can buy and sell textbooks directly from one another.

    Project Requirements: Develop an application that satisfy the the following
    - Database driven
    - Create/Modify User Information
        - Allow users to register for accounts
    - Create/Modify Items for Sale
